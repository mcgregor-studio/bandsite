## Description

This is the second project that I created during the Brainstation web development program. I was responsible for the following: 

# Tools & Resources
- Make use of a design package (assets, style guide, and creative mockup) to create a functional and 
  responsive site

# Functional Requirements
- Return Home Link: Located in the top-left corner of the nav is the wordmark / logo "BANDSITE". Clicking on this should return visitors to the bio page.

# Visual Design Requirements
- The site must resemble the mockups and design specs provided in the design package
- The site must be responsive at all dimensions, including between, above & below the provided   
  break-points (between 320px and 1920px your site should be consistent)
- The site must be approached using a mobile-first design approach.
- Responsive units used wherever possible in order to have elements respond to changes in the 
  browser window size. Use px values to calculate responsive units wherever necessary.

# Implementation Requirements
- Sass must be used for all styling, and take advantage of Sass variables, plus any other Sass features 
  that can help improve the code.
- Class naming for all styling must use BEM.
- Layout of the site must use Flexbox. 

# Additional Skills
I have also included the following: 
- Navigation Hover: Hover effects have been added to the navigation in accordance with the style guide.
- Photo Gallery Hover: Use of the filter property to have the images of the gallery grayscale by default, and when the user hovers over each image it returns to color.
- Mailto Link: Located in the footer of the web page is the contact information for several agents. Clicking on the email addresses listed should open up a user's mail account where they can begin to draft a message to the specific contact.
